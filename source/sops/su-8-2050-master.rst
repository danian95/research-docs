SU-8 2050 Master Preparation
============================

1.  Preheat one hotplate to 65°C and another hotplate to 95°C

2.  Pour 4 mL SU-8 into a scintillation vial, wrap the vial in aluminum
    foil, and let it sit until bubbles are gone

3.  Rinse a 3” silicon wafer with IPA (the wafer can be Piranha cleaned
    if necessary)

4.  Line the spin coater walls with aluminum foil and turn on the vacuum
    pump to the spin coater

5.  Place wafer on spin coater and test run Recipe 5

    a. Press RECIPE, then 5

    b. Verify steps by pressing STEP, then the number of the step, then
       SPEED/RAMP

       i.   500 RPM for 5 s with 100 RPM/s ramp

       ii.  1750 RPM for 30 s with 300 RPM/s ramp

       iii. 0 RPM with 200 RPM/s ramp

    c. Press the green foot pedal to start the run

    d. Once the wafer has stopped spinning, press the red foot pedal to
       stop the run followed by the green foot pedal to reset the spin
       coater

6.  Pour the SU-8 onto the center of the wafer

7.  Run Recipe 5

8.  Softbake

    a. Transfer wafer to 65°C hotplate for 5 minutes

    b. Transfer wafer to 95°C hotplate for 20 minutes

9.  Tape photomask emulsion side up on a quartz plate

10. Place the quartz plate with emulsion side down directly on to SU-8
    coated wafer

11. Expose to 100% power UV LED for 30 s and remove the quartz with
    photomask

12. Postbake

    a. Transfer wafer to 65°C hotplate for 5 minutes

    b. Transfer wafer to 95°C hotplate for 10 minutes

13. Immerse the wafer in an evaporating dish containing PGMEA for 10
    minutes

14. Rinse wafer with PGMEA followed by IPA

15. Dry with N\ :sub:`2` gas

16. Verify structures with stereoscope
