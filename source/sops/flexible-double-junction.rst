Preparation of a Double-Junction Reference Chamber with Flexible Tip
====================================================================

1. Slide Zeus TFE 24 SW Heat Shrink 2:1 tubing over tip of Pasteur
   pipet.

2. Score the Pasteur pipet using a diamond-tip where the extent of the
   heat shrink meets the pipet. Remove the heat shrink and snap off the
   tip of the Pasteur pipet. Use a propane torch to smooth any sharp
   edges at the tip of the pipet.

   a. The other end (larger diameter end) of the Pasteur pipet may also
      be shortened, if necessary, by scoring at the desired length and
      breaking off the excess glass. Flame this edge also to remove any
      sharp points.

   b. A piece of clear vinyl tubing (1/4 ID - 1/16 WALL) fits over the
      large end of the Pasteur pipet and may be used to support the
      reference electrode in the double-junction chamber.

3. Cut a small amount of the heat shrink to use as a connector between
   the tip of the shortened Pasteur pipet and 20 GA clear PTFE tubing.
   Use a heat gun to shrink the heat shrink.

   a. Another larger diameter heat shrink tubing piece may be necessary
      to fully secure the clear PTFE tubing to the Pasteur pipet.

4. Cut another small amount of heat shrink for the other end of the PTFE
   tubing. Insert a 3 Ã… molecular sieve pellet (Aldrich cat# 334286)
   into the heat shrink. Use a heat gun to shrink the heat shrink.

5. The double-junction reference chamber should be stored in the same
   manner as the reference electrodes. For the BASi Ag/AgCl RE, for
   example, the double-junction should be filled with and stored in a
   vial containing 3 M NaCl.

   a. The flexible tip of the double-junction is best filled with a
      syringe and narrow polyethylene tubing (PE10 011 X024 IN).

   b. Allow to sit in storage overnight before checking junction
      potential.
