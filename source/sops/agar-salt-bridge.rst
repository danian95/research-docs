Preparation of an Agar Salt Bridge
==================================

1. Heat ultrapure water on hotplate (very hot, but not boiling) and stir
   with magnetic stir bar

2. Dissolve 0.2 M electrolyte (such as KNO\ :sub:`3` or NaClO\ :sub:`4`)

3. Dissolve 3% agar

4. Once everything dissolved, remove from heat

5. Draw solution up into Pasteur pipette with bulb and allow pipette to
   sit with tip immersed and bulb still attached until agar solidifies

6. Junctions can remain in this position until use

7. 30 minutes prior to use, add desired electrolyte solution to top of
   double junction and Parafilm reference electrode to top

8. Measure junction potential to ensure accurate potentials
