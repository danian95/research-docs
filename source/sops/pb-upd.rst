Pb UPD
======

1. Pb UPD solution should already be present in a 5-neck flask. If not,
   the following solution should be prepared in 18.2 MΩ cm\ :sup:`-1`
   Millipore water and transferred to the flask:

..

   0.003 M Pb(ClO\ :sub:`4`)\ :sub:`2` MW: 406.1 g mol\ :sup:`-1`

   0.1 M NaClO\ :sub:`4` MW: 122.44 g mol\ :sup:`-1`

   0.01 M HClO\ :sub:`4` (adjust to pH 2)

2. N\ :sub:`2` gas should be supplied through a Pasteur pipet to the
   solution in order to purge the solution for 2 hours before running
   experiments. Another gas line should exit the flask and be connected
   to a vacuum flask containing water. The vacuum flask with water will
   allow for visual verification that N\ :sub:`2` gas is flowing when
   you are no longer bubbling the solution and will indicate if there
   are leaks in the 5-neck flask.

3. Prepare electrodes:

..

   Working

   Rinse with 18.2 MΩ cm\ :sup:`-1` Millipore water and dry with
   N\ :sub:`2` gas.

   Counter (Pt wire)

   Immerse in 1:1 (v/v) HNO\ :sub:`3`:H\ :sub:`2`\ O heated to 50°C for
   a few seconds. Rinse with 18.2 MΩ cm\ :sup:`-1` Millipore water and
   dry with N\ :sub:`2` gas. Flame anneal over a propane torch until
   platinum is glowing red.

   Reference (Pb wire)

   Immerse in 1(v/v) HNO\ :sub:`3`:H\ :sub:`2`\ O heated to 50°C for a
   few seconds (the Pb will dissolve if left submerged for too long).
   Rinse with 18.2 MΩ cm\ :sup:`-1` Millipore water and dry with
   N\ :sub:`2` gas.

4. Set potentiostat parameters as follows:

..

   Technique = Cyclic Voltammetry

   E\ :sub:`initial` = +650 mV

   E\ :sub:`high` = +650 mV

   E\ :sub:`low` = +20 mV

   E\ :sub:`final` = +650 mV

   Scan Rate = 20, 10, or 5 mV s\ :sup:`-1`

   Number of Segments = 6 (or 4 if 5 mV s\ :sup:`-1`)

5. When ready to run, ensure all electrodes are in solution. Pull
   N\ :sub:`2` gas Pasteur pipet out of solution so that N\ :sub:`2` gas
   is passed over the solution, but not bubbling. Run with desired
   parameters.

6. When finished, return N\ :sub:`2` gas Pasteur pipet to solution to
   continue bubbling. Turn Pb wire reference electrode so that it is not
   sitting in solution (the Pb will dissolve and change the Pb
   concentration of the solution). Remove the working electrode.

7. If finished for the day, stop N\ :sub:`2` gas purge. Remove all
   electrodes and rinse them with distilled water. Cap 5-neck flask to
   prevent spills or contamination.
