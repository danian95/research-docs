Ag/AgCl Reference Electrode Check
=================================

1. While the pH meter is **off**, disconnect the pH electrode from the
   BNC connector on the back of the meter. Replace with a BNC to
   two-wire splitter. Attach alligator clips to each of the wires.

2. Immerse the red-labeled Master Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a 3 M
   NaCl solution and connect the electrode to the ground (GND) alligator
   clip.

..

   **Note:** The Master is only used to check the potentials of other
   reference electrodes and must never be used for an actual
   electrochemical experiment.

3. Immerse the Ag/AgCl electrode you would like to check in the 3 M NaCl
   solution and connect it to the other alligator clip.

4. Turn the pH meter on and wait until a pH is displayed. Press the
   |image0| button until the |image1| icon is shown. Press |image2| to
   take a measurement.

5. Once the reading stabilizes, the |image3|\ icon should stop flashing.
   The value should only be a few tenths of a mV off. If necessary,
   record the new correction on a new label for the electrode. If the
   reading is 10 or more mV different from the Master, do not use the
   reference electrode.

6. Return the pH meter to pH mode by pressing |image4| until the
   |image5| icon is displayed. Turn off the pH meter.

7. Disconnect the BNC connection and replace it with the pH electrode.
