Preparing PDMS with SU-8 Master
===============================

1. Preheat an oven to 70Â°C

2. Mix 9 g PDMS and 1 g curing agent for a 9:1 ratio in a plastic weigh
   boat using a wooden tongue depressor (the amount of PDMS and curing
   agent used can be altered if thinner or thicker PDMS layers are
   desired)

3. Degas the PDMS for 10-20 minutes in a vacuum desiccator until bubbles
   are gone

4. Place SU-8 master on bottom of plastic evaporating dish, mold side up

5. Pour PDMS slowly onto center of mold

6. Transfer to oven for 1 hour

7. Carefully peel PDMS from the mold (a razor blade can be used to help
   in PDMS removal)

8. Use blunt syringe tips to puncture the PDMS where inlet and outlet
   ports are desired
